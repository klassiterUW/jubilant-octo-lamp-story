It was dark in the hangar as Iko entered through the side. The main door was shut -- a rare
occurrence as Jin was always complaining about how hot it got in there. "Where is Jin" Iko
thought to herself. He was alwayss tinkering, making some modification to their ship. "If
I reroute power through this junction, The accelerator and injector will share the same
bus, cutting our energy expenditure by half a percent. . ." he would say to no one in 
particular as he worked. But as Iko made a quick pass around the hangar, she heard nothing,
she saw nothing. Something was wrong.
