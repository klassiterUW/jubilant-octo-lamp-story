It was dark in the hangar as Iko entered through the side. The main door was shut -- a rare
occurrence as Jin was always complaining about how hot it got in there. "Where is Jin" Iko
thought to herself. He was alwayss tinkering, making some modification to their ship. "If
I reroute power through this junction, The accelerator and injector will share the same
bus, cutting our energy expenditure by half a percent. . ." he would say to no one in 
particular as he worked. But as Iko made a quick pass around the hangar, she heard nothing,
she saw nothing. Something was wrong.

Suddenly, waves started forming. What seemed like a silent sea became full enraged. It was lokking as if something was coming out of the water. Seeing all this, Iko got scared. She called out for Jin but there  was no reply. Panicked Iko tried her best to manage the situation. Suddenly, she heard Jin calling for help and then she ran for to her rescue.

With every step she took, she felt she has stepped into an icehouse. Trembling uncontrollably, Iko moved her sights into the waves, a sunken ship appeared from nowhere. Though tattered, it floated on the sea. Wind was blowing heavily, yet inside those noisy winds, Iko heard pirates singing their ship song.
